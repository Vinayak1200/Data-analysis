# Data analysis:
This repository contains various data analysis projects I have learnt, 
ranging from movie data analysis to sales analysis


# TMDb-movie-dataset-analysis

# About dataset :
The dataset consists of movies released on or before July 2017. Data points include cast, crew, plot keywords, budget, revenue, posters, release dates, languages, production companies, countries, TMDB vote counts and vote averages.

This dataset also has files containing 26 million ratings from 270,000 users for all 45,000 movies. Ratings are on a scale of 1-5 and have been obtained from the official GroupLens website.

# Sales data analysis;
This data analysis is done in the file loaddata.py
It looks at the sales data of the year 2020 and 2019, and creates
various statistical descriptions about that data.

# Titanic data analysis:
This jupyter notebook analyses the data of the passengers
of the RMS Titanic, which sank on april 15, 1912  after striking an 
iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton, 
UK, to New York City.

# Lego data analysis:
This is another practice mini project, involving data analysis of products sold by the very famous company, Lego.
The product data is in the excel files, giving detailed information of every Lego set sold.
The project has 2 main objectives :    (i) Finding percentage of Star Wars themed lego sets sold till present.
                                       (ii) Finding the year in which Star Wars was not the popular Lego sets theme.
